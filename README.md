## Dependencies

Node.js with npm is required. So is Ruby and Sass (> 3.4.0 for
sourcemaps)

-----
## Install

Install all dependencies with npm using `npm install`.

We use Gulp to build the application. Just type in `gulp` to spin up
a server. This compiles your Sass, builds your JS assets with browserify
and starts up a LiveReload server so any changes on your html, Sass or
JS will automatically be reflected in your browser.

With gulp running, you should be able to see your site at
`http://localhost:3000`.
